# wp_check_plugin_dir

Script to check the plugins in your Wordpress plugin directory against the vulndb.com api.

You get an output of all known vulnerabilities in vulndb.com for these plugins.

This script currently doesn't check themes or the Wordpress core nor does it check the version of your plugins, so it's pretty basic.

Be warned: The vulnerabilitiy list might scare you.
